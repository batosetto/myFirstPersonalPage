                I have arrived in Canada few months ago. So... What am I doing here? <br>
                As you can see in my <a class="heading-menu-iten" href="resume.html" target="_blank">Resume</a> page, I'm civil engineer and I worked for 10 years with constructions and project management. <br>
                However, I'm not the kind of person who enjoyes doing the same thing for too long (or living in the same place).<br>
                So I decided to start a new carreer from zero. But this challenge didn't seem to be that big, I wanted more: start a new carreer in a different country. <br>
                That's why we are here :)
                But... who are we? <br>
                Me, my husband and our two dogs: Joca and Zeca (in fact we have three dogs, but one of them couldn't come with us because of his big size and now he lives with my parents-in-law.).

As I am old, I'd rather sleep all day long on the sofa and my mom says that I am the most behaved dog she has ever seen! ";

Sometimes my mom is sad about it, because I always put her in trouble... but, she always says that I'm her favourite dog! I know she loves more 'cause I'm nuts =P";
